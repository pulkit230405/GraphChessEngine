# GraphChessEngine

A chess engine with graph theory visualization built using Python and Pygame. It uses Stockfish for strong move calculation and adds educational features to help understand chess through graph-based techniques.

---

## ♟️ Features

- ✔️ Interactive chessboard using **Pygame**
- 🔁 **Undo** button to reverse moves
- 📊 **Evaluation bar** to show engine’s perspective
- 🧠 **Top Stockfish move suggestions**
- 🧩 **Graph-based visualizations** (e.g., knight's shortest path, attack patterns)
- 🌲 **Minimax tree visualization** to show game state predictions
- ♖ Loads chess piece images dynamically


## 🚀 Getting Started for those who wan use my repo

1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GraphChessEngine.git
cd GraphChessEngine
2. Install dependencies
pip install pygame python-chess
3. Run the engine
python my_chess.py
Make sure the Stockfish engine binary is present in the specified path inside the code.

🧠 Educational Focus
This project highlights how graph theory concepts can be applied in chess:

📍 Knight's shortest path → modeled using BFS

⚔️ Attack pattern graphs → to show positional pressure

🧮 Minimax tree → helps visualize depth search of moves
